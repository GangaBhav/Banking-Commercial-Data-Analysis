# Banking and Commercial Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data from banking and commercial sectors to extract meaningful insights and support better decision-making. The analysis covers three key domains: Retail Banking Operations, Commercial Lending, and Customer Behavior Analytics.

## Project Overview

Working with financial data can be challenging, but understanding customer patterns, transaction trends, and risk factors is crucial for any banking institution. This project breaks down complex datasets into clear, actionable insights using SQL queries, Python analysis, and visual dashboards.

## Three Analysis Domains

### 1. Retail Banking Operations Analysis

Retail banking generates massive amounts of transaction data daily. This analysis examines:

- Transaction patterns across different customer segments
- Peak banking hours and seasonal trends
- ATM and branch usage statistics
- Account opening and closure trends
- Customer service interaction analysis

The goal here is to understand how customers interact with banking services and identify opportunities to improve service delivery.

### 2. Commercial Lending Assessment

Commercial lending requires careful evaluation of risk and return. This domain covers:

- Loan approval rates and rejection patterns
- Credit score distribution analysis
- Industry-wise lending trends
- Loan default prediction indicators
- Payment behavior tracking
- Portfolio risk assessment

By analyzing historical lending data, we can identify factors that contribute to successful loans and flag potential risks early.

### 3. Customer Behavior Analytics

Understanding what drives customer decisions helps banks offer better products. This section explores:

- Customer segmentation based on transaction behavior
- Product adoption rates and preferences
- Cross-selling opportunities
- Customer lifetime value analysis
- Churn prediction and retention factors
- Digital vs. branch banking preferences

These insights help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Technical Approach

### Data Sources

The project uses sample datasets that mirror real banking scenarios:
- Customer demographics and account information
- Transaction logs
- Loan applications and repayment records
- Customer service interactions

### Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation
- **Python**: For statistical analysis and modeling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and transformation
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations
- **Azure Data Factory**: Data pipeline orchestration
- **Databricks**: Advanced analytics and processing

### Analysis Workflow

1. Data Collection: Gathering data from multiple sources
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
3. Exploratory Analysis: Understanding distributions and relationships
4. Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful metrics
5. Visualization: Building dashboards for stakeholders
6. Insights Generation: Translating findings into recommendations

## Key Insights

Through this analysis, several patterns emerge:

- High-value transactions peak during mid-month periods
- Customers with multiple products show 40% lower churn rates
- Small business loans have higher approval rates in specific industries
- Digital banking adoption correlates with customer age and location
- Early payment delays are strong indicators of potential defaults

3. Open Power BI dashboards to visualize trends interactively
4. Review documentation for detailed methodology and findings

## Business Impact

This type of analysis helps banking institutions:

- Optimize branch operations based on customer flow patterns
- Reduce loan default rates through better risk assessment
- Increase customer retention by identifying at-risk accounts
- Improve product offerings based on customer preferences
- Make data-driven decisions about resource allocation

## Future Enhancements

- Implement real-time fraud detection algorithms
- Add sentiment analysis from customer feedback
- Build predictive models for loan approval automation
- Create personalized product recommendation engine
- Integrate external economic indicators for better forecasting
